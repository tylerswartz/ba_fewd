GA's back-end web development class


<strong>Class Notes</strong>

<em>2.24.15</em>

Web development is creating web sites that <em>do something</em>.

Front end is the visual experience on the browser. (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Back end is the browser interaction with the server. (Ruby, Java, PHP, JavaScript).

Back end development is very complex and there is always more to learn. It never stops being challenging and there is never a shortage of work to do.

Think like a developer. When you get stuck on a problem it's important to follow these steps.
<ol>
	<li>Stop (take your hands off the keyboard).</li>
	<li>Think: 'what problem am I trying to solve?'</li>
	<li>Think: 'what assumptions am I making?'</li>
	<li>Think: 'how can I solve it?' (trust your first instinct)</li>
	<li>If you're not sure, do reasearch or ask peers.</li>
	<li>Once you understand it, then you write your code.</li>
</ol>

Stop -> Think -> Code
