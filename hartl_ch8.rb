# Bulding and sorting an array

puts "Hi, I'm going to sort a-z any words you'd like. Start by typing your words, when you are done just press enter on an empty line. Ready...give me some words:"

words = []

x = gets
puts x
# while gets != '\n'
# 	new_word = gets.chomp.upcase
# 	words.push new_word
# end

# words.sort

# puts words
